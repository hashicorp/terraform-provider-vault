  Creates an RabbitMQ secret backend for Vault.

# vault\_rabbitmq\_secret\_backend

Creates an RabbitMQ Secret Backend for Vault. RabbitMQ secret backends can then issue RabbitMQ credentials,
 once a role has been added to the backend.

~> **Important** All data provided in the resource configuration will be
written in cleartext to state and plan files generated by Terraform, and
will appear in the console output when Terraform runs. Protect these
artifacts accordingly. See
[the main provider documentation](../index.html)
for more details.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "vault_rabbitmq_secret_backend" "rabbitmq" {
  connection_uri  = "https://....."
  username        = "user"
  password        = "password"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `namespace` - (Optional) The namespace to provision the resource in.
  The value should not contain leading or trailing forward slashes.
  The `namespace` is always relative to the provider's configured [namespace](/docs/providers/vault/index.html#namespace).
   *Available only for Vault Enterprise*.

* `connection_uri` - (Required)  Specifies the RabbitMQ connection URI.

* `username` - (Required) Specifies the RabbitMQ management administrator username.

* `password` - (Required) Specifies the RabbitMQ management administrator password.

* `verify_connection` - (Optional) Specifies whether to verify connection URI, username, and password.
Defaults to `true`.

* `password_policy` - (Optional) Specifies a password policy to use when creating dynamic credentials. Defaults to generating an alphanumeric password if not set.

* `username_template` - (Optional) Template describing how dynamic usernames are generated.

~> **Important** Because Vault does not support reading the configured
credentials back from the API, Terraform cannot detect and correct drift
on `connection_uri`, `username`, `password`, `verify_connection`, `username_template`, and `password_policy`. Changing the values, however, _will_
overwrite the previously stored values.

* `path` - (Optional) The unique path this backend should be mounted at. Must
not begin or end with a `/`. Defaults to `rabbitmq`.

* `disable_remount` - (Optional) If set, opts out of mount migration on path updates.
  See here for more info on [Mount Migration](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/concepts/mount-migration)

### Common Mount Arguments
These arguments are common across all resources that mount a secret engine.

* `description` - (Optional) Human-friendly description of the mount

* `default_lease_ttl_seconds` - (Optional) Default lease duration for tokens and secrets in seconds

* `max_lease_ttl_seconds` - (Optional) Maximum possible lease duration for tokens and secrets in seconds

* `audit_non_hmac_response_keys` - (Optional) Specifies the list of keys that will not be HMAC'd by audit devices in the response data object.

* `audit_non_hmac_request_keys` - (Optional) Specifies the list of keys that will not be HMAC'd by audit devices in the request data object.

* `local` - (Optional) Boolean flag that can be explicitly set to true to enforce local mount in HA environment

* `options` - (Optional) Specifies mount type specific options that are passed to the backend

* `seal_wrap` - (Optional) Boolean flag that can be explicitly set to true to enable seal wrapping for the mount, causing values stored by the mount to be wrapped by the seal's encryption capability

* `external_entropy_access` - (Optional) Boolean flag that can be explicitly set to true to enable the secrets engine to access Vault's external entropy source

* `allowed_managed_keys` - (Optional) Set of managed key registry entry names that the mount in question is allowed to access

* `listing_visibility` - (Optional) Specifies whether to show this mount in the UI-specific
  listing endpoint. Valid values are `unauth` or `hidden`. If not set, behaves like `hidden`.

* `passthrough_request_headers` - (Optional) List of headers to allow and pass from the request to
  the plugin.

* `allowed_response_headers` - (Optional) List of headers to allow, allowing a plugin to include
  them in the response.

* `delegated_auth_accessors` - (Optional)  List of allowed authentication mount accessors the
  backend can request delegated authentication for.

* `plugin_version` - (Optional) Specifies the semantic version of the plugin to use, e.g. "v1.0.0".
  If unspecified, the server will select any matching unversioned plugin that may have been
  registered, the latest versioned plugin registered, or a built-in plugin in that order of precedence.

* `identity_token_key` - (Optional)  The key to use for signing plugin workload identity tokens. If
  not provided, this will default to Vault's OIDC default key. Requires Vault Enterprise 1.16+.
