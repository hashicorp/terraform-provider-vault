  Manages keys in the Vault Key Management secrets engine

# vault\_keymgmt\_key

Manages keys in the Vault Key Management secrets engine. This resource creates and manages cryptographic keys that can be distributed to external Key Management Services (KMS).

Keys created with this resource can be distributed to AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault, or GCP Cloud KMS using the appropriate distribution resources.

~> **Important**
All data provided in the resource configuration will be written in cleartext to
state and plan files generated by Terraform, and will appear in the console
output when Terraform runs. Protect these artifacts accordingly. See [the main provider documentation](../index.html) for more details.

For more information on Key Management in Vault, please refer to the Vault [documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/secrets/key-management).

**Note** this feature is available only with Vault Enterprise.

## Example Usage

### Basic Symmetric Key

```hcl
resource "vault_mount" "keymgmt" {
  path = "keymgmt"
  type = "keymgmt"
}

resource "vault_keymgmt_key" "aes_key" {
  path = vault_mount.keymgmt.path
  name = "aes-encryption-key"
  type = "aes256-gcm96"
}
```

### RSA Key with Deletion Protection

```hcl
resource "vault_keymgmt_key" "rsa_key" {
  path            = vault_mount.keymgmt.path
  name            = "rsa-signing-key"
  type            = "rsa-2048"
  deletion_allowed = false
}
```

### Key with Replication to Multiple Regions

```hcl
resource "vault_keymgmt_key" "replicated_key" {
  path = vault_mount.keymgmt.path
  name = "multi-region-key"
  type = "aes256-gcm96"
  
  replica_regions = ["us-west-1", "us-east-1", "eu-west-1"]
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `namespace` - (Optional) The namespace of the target resource.
  The value should not contain leading or trailing forward slashes.
  The `namespace` is always relative to the provider's configured
  [namespace](/docs/providers/vault/index.html#namespace).
  *Available only for Vault Enterprise*.

* `path` - (Required) Path where the Key Management secrets engine is mounted.

* `name` - (Required) Name of the key. This cannot be changed after creation.

* `type` - (Required) Type of cryptographic key to create. Cannot be changed after creation. Valid values are:
  - `aes256-gcm96` - AES-256 wrapped with GCM using a 96-bit nonce (symmetric)
  - `rsa-2048` - RSA with 2048 bits (asymmetric)
  - `rsa-3072` - RSA with 3072 bits (asymmetric)
  - `rsa-4096` - RSA with 4096 bits (asymmetric)
  - `ecdsa-p256` - ECDSA using curve P-256 (asymmetric)
  - `ecdsa-p384` - ECDSA using curve P-384 (asymmetric)
  - `ecdsa-p521` - ECDSA using curve P-521 (asymmetric)
  - `ed25519` - Ed25519 signature algorithm (asymmetric)
  - `hmac` - HMAC key for message authentication

* `deletion_allowed` - (Optional) If set to `true`, the key can be deleted. Defaults to `false`. Once enabled, the key can be destroyed using Terraform.

* `replica_regions` - (Optional) Set of AWS regions where the key should be replicated. This is only applicable when distributing keys to AWS KMS and enables multi-region key replication. Example: `["us-west-1", "us-east-1", "eu-west-1"]`.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The unique identifier for the key resource. Format: `{path}/key/{name}`

* `latest_version` - The latest version number of the key.

* `min_enabled_version` - The minimum enabled version of the key.

## Import

Key Management keys can be imported using the format `{path}/key/{name}`, e.g.

```
$ terraform import vault_keymgmt_key.aes_key keymgmt/key/aes-encryption-key
```
