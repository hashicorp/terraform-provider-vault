# vault\ad\_secret\_backend\_library

Creates a library on an Active Directory Secret Backend for Vault. Libraries create
a pool of existing Active Directory service accounts which can be checked out
by users.

~> **Important** All data provided in the resource configuration will be
written in cleartext to state and plan files generated by Terraform, and
will appear in the console output when Terraform runs. Protect these
artifacts accordingly. See
[the main provider documentation](../index.html)
for more details.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "vault_ad_secret_backend" "config" {
    backend       = "ad"
    binddn        = "CN=Administrator,CN=Users,DC=corp,DC=example,DC=net"
    bindpass      = "SuperSecretPassw0rd"
    url           = "ldaps://ad"
    insecure_tls  = "true"
    userdn        = "CN=Users,DC=corp,DC=example,DC=net"
}

resource "vault_ad_secret_library" "qa" {
    backend                       = vault_ad_secret_backend.config.backend
    name                          = "qa"
    service_account_names         = ["Bob", "Mary"]
    ttl                           = 60
