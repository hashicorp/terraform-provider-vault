# vault\_consul\_secret\_backend

Creates a Consul Secret Backend for Vault. Consul secret backends can then issue Consul tokens, once a role has been
added to the backend.

~> **Important** All data provided in the resource configuration will be
written in cleartext to state and plan files generated by Terraform, and
will appear in the console output when Terraform runs. Protect these
artifacts accordingly. See
[the main provider documentation](../index.html)
for more details.

## Example Usage

#### Creating a standard backend resource:
```hcl
resource "vault_consul_secret_backend" "test" {
  path        = "consul"
  description = "Manages the Consul backend"
  address     = "127.0.0.1:8500"
  token       = "4240861b-ce3d-8530-115a-521ff070dd29"
}
```

#### Creating a backend resource to bootstrap a new Consul instance:
```hcl
resource "vault_consul_secret_backend" "test" {
  path        = "consul"
  description = "Bootstrap the Consul backend"
  address     = "127.0.0.1:8500"
  bootstrap   = true
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `namespace` - (Optional) The namespace to provision the resource in.
  The value should not contain leading or trailing forward slashes.
  The `namespace` is always relative to the provider's configured [namespace](/docs/providers/vault#namespace).
   *Available only for Vault Enterprise*.

* `token` - (Optional) The Consul management token this backend should use to issue new tokens. This field is required
when `bootstrap` is false.

~> **Important** Because Vault does not support reading the configured token back from the API, Terraform cannot detect
and correct drift on `token`. Changing the value, however, _will_ overwrite the previously stored values.

* `bootstrap` - (Optional) Denotes that the resource is used to bootstrap the Consul ACL system.

~> **Important** When `bootstrap` is true, Vault will attempt to bootstrap the Consul server. The token returned from
this operation will only ever be known to Vault. If the resource is ever destroyed, the bootstrap token will be lost
and a [Consul reset may be required.](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/consul/access-control-troubleshoot#reset-the-acl-system)

* `path` - (Optional) The unique location this backend should be mounted at. Must not begin or end with a `/`. Defaults
to `consul`.

* `disable_remount` - (Optional) If set, opts out of mount migration on path updates.
  See here for more info on [Mount Migration](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/concepts/mount-migration)

* `description` - (Optional) A human-friendly description for this backend.

* `address` - (Required) Specifies the address of the Consul instance, provided as "host:port" like "127.0.0.1:8500".

* `scheme` - (Optional) Specifies the URL scheme to use. Defaults to `http`.

* `ca_cert` - (Optional) CA certificate to use when verifying Consul server certificate, must be x509 PEM encoded.

* `client_cert` - (Optional) Client certificate used for Consul's TLS communication, must be x509 PEM encoded and if
this is set you need to also set client_key.

* `client_key` - (Optional) Client key used for Consul's TLS communication, must be x509 PEM encoded and if this is set
you need to also set client_cert.

* `default_lease_ttl_seconds` - (Optional) The default TTL for credentials issued by this backend.

* `max_lease_ttl_seconds` - (Optional) The maximum TTL that can be requested
for credentials issued by this backend.

* `local` - (Optional) Specifies if the secret backend is local only.

## Attributes Reference

No additional attributes are exported by this resource.

## Import

Consul secret backends can be imported using the `path`, e.g.

```
