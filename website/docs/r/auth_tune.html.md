  Writes auth method tuning for Vault

# vault\_auth\_tune

~> **Important** Some resources support tuning of an auth method directly, and
  therefore may present a conflict or configuration loop if used in conjunction
  with `vault_auth_tune`. This resource is intended to be used in situations
  where an auth method or mount is not tuned via alternative methods.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "vault_auth_tune" "example" {
  path = vault_auth_backend.approle.path

  default_lease_ttl  = "12h"
  max_lease_ttl      = "72h"
  listing_visibility = "hidden"
  token_type         = "service"

  user_lockout_config {
    lockout_disable       = false
    lockout_threshold     = "10"
    lockout_duration      = "60s"
    lockout_counter_reset = "1h"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `namespace` - (Optional) The namespace to provision the resource in.
  The value should not contain leading or trailing forward slashes.
  The `namespace` is always relative to the provider's configured [namespace](/docs/providers/vault#namespace).
   *Available only for Vault Enterprise*.

* `path` - (Required) The path to mount the auth method to tune.

* `default_lease_ttl` - (Optional) Specifies the default time-to-live.
  If set, this overrides the global default.
  Must be a valid [duration string](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration)

* `max_lease_ttl` - (Optional) Specifies the maximum time-to-live.
  If set, this overrides the global default.
  Must be a valid [duration string](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration)

* `audit_non_hmac_response_keys` - (Optional) Specifies the list of keys that will
  not be HMAC'd by audit devices in the response data object.

* `audit_non_hmac_request_keys` - (Optional) Specifies the list of keys that will
  not be HMAC'd by audit devices in the request data object.

* `listing_visibility` - (Optional) Specifies whether to show this mount in
  the UI-specific listing endpoint. Valid values are "unauth" or "hidden".

* `passthrough_request_headers` - (Optional) List of headers to whitelist and
  pass from the request to the backend.

* `allowed_response_headers` - (Optional) List of headers to whitelist and allowing
  a plugin to include them in the response.

* `token_type` - (Optional) Specifies the type of tokens that should be returned by
  the mount. Valid values are "default-service", "default-batch", "service", "batch".

* `plugin_version` - (Optional) Specifies the semantic version of the plugin to
  use, e.g. \"v1.0.0\". Changes will not take effect until the mount is reloaded.

* `user_lockout_config` - (Optional) A nested block containing configuration
  options for user lockout. User lockout feature was added in Vault 1.13.

### User Lockout Options

~> **Important** User lockout in Vault is currently only supported for LDAP,
  AppRole, and userpass auth methods. Lockout options specified for unsupported
  auth methods are ignored by this resource and will persist as outstanding
  changes in Terraform plans until removed from the Terraform configuration.

* `lockout_threshold` - (Optional) Specifies the number of failed login attempts
  after which the user is locked out, specified as a string like \"15\".

* `lockout_duration` - (Optional) Specifies the duration for which an user will
  be locked out, specified as a string duration like \"5s\" or \"30m\"..

* `lockout_counter_reset` - (Optional) Specifies the duration after which the
  lockout counter is reset with no failed login attempts, specified as a string
  duration like \"5s\" or \"30m\".

* `lockout_disable` - (Optional) Disables the user lockout feature for this
  mount if set to true. Defaults to false.

## Import

Auth method tuning can be imported using the `path`, e.g.

```
$ terraform import vault_auth_tune.example approle
```
