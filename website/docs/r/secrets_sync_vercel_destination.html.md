written in cleartext to state and plan files generated by Terraform, and
will appear in the console output when Terraform runs. Protect these
artifacts accordingly. See

for more details.

  project_id              = var.project_id
  deployment_environments = ["development", "preview", "production"]
  secret_name_template    = "vault_{{ .MountAccessor | lowercase }}_{{ .SecretPath | lowercase }}"
}
