# vault\_secrets\_sync\_vercel\_destination

Creates a Vercel destination to synchronize secrets in Vault. Requires Vault 1.16+.
*Available only for Vault Enterprise*.

~> **Important** All data provided in the resource configuration will be
written in cleartext to state and plan files generated by Terraform, and
will appear in the console output when Terraform runs. Protect these
artifacts accordingly. See
[the main provider documentation](../index.html)
for more details.

For more information on syncing secrets with Vercel, please refer to the Vault
[documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/sync/vercelproject).

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "vault_secrets_sync_vercel_destination" "vercel" {
  name                    = "vercel-dest"
  access_token            = var.access_token
  project_id              = var.project_id
  deployment_environments = ["development", "preview", "production"]
  secret_name_template    = "vault_{{ .MountAccessor | lowercase }}_{{ .SecretPath | lowercase }}"
  
  # Networking allowlist fields (Vault 1.19+)
  # IP addresses must be in CIDR notation
  allowed_ipv4_addresses    = ["192.168.1.1/32", "10.0.0.1/32"]
  allowed_ipv6_addresses    = ["2001:db8:85a3::8a2e:370:7334/128"]
  allowed_ports             = [443, 8443]
  disable_strict_networking = false
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `namespace` - (Optional) The namespace to provision the resource in.
  The value should not contain leading or trailing forward slashes.
  The `namespace` is always relative to the provider's configured [namespace](/docs/providers/vault/index.html#namespace).

* `name` - (Required) Unique name of the GitHub destination.

* `access_token` - (Required) Vercel API access token with the permissions to manage environment
  variables.

* `project_id` - (Required) Project ID where to manage environment variables.

* `deployment_environments` - (Required) Deployment environments where the environment variables
  are available. Accepts `development`, `preview` and `production`.

* `team_id` - (Optional) Team ID where to manage environment variables.

* `secret_name_template` - (Optional) Template describing how to generate external secret names.
  Supports a subset of the Go Template syntax.

* `granularity` - (Optional) Determines what level of information is synced as a distinct resource
  at the destination. Supports `secret-path` and `secret-key`.

* `allowed_ipv4_addresses` - (Optional) Set of allowed IPv4 addresses in CIDR notation (e.g., `192.168.1.1/32`)
  for outbound connections from Vault to the destination. If not set, all IPv4 addresses are allowed.
  Requires Vault 1.19+.

* `allowed_ipv6_addresses` - (Optional) Set of allowed IPv6 addresses in CIDR notation (e.g., `2001:db8::1/128`)
  for outbound connections from Vault to the destination. If not set, all IPv6 addresses are allowed.
  Requires Vault 1.19+.

* `allowed_ports` - (Optional) Set of allowed ports for outbound connections from Vault to the
  destination. If not set, all ports are allowed. Requires Vault 1.19+.

* `disable_strict_networking` - (Optional) If set to `true`, disables strict networking enforcement
  for this destination. When disabled, Vault will not enforce allowed IP addresses and ports.
  Defaults to `false`. Requires Vault 1.19+.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported in addition to the above:

* `type` - The type of the secrets destination (`vercel-project`).

## Import

Vercel Secrets sync destinations can be imported using the `name`, e.g.

```
$ terraform import vault_secrets_sync_vercel_destination.vercel vercel-dest
```
