# vault\_identity\_entity

Creates an Identity Entity for Vault. The Identity secrets engine is the identity management solution for Vault. It internally maintains the clients who are recognized by Vault.

~> **Important** All data provided in the resource configuration will be
written in cleartext to state and plan files generated by Terraform, and
will appear in the console output when Terraform runs. Protect these
artifacts accordingly. See
[the main provider documentation](../index.html)
for more details.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "vault_identity_entity" "test" {
  name      = "tester1"
  policies  = ["test"]
  metadata  = {
    foo = "bar"
  }
}
```
