# vault\_aws\_auth\_backend\_role

Manages an AWS auth backend role in a Vault server. Roles constrain the
instances or principals that can perform the login operation against the
backend. See the [Vault
documentation](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/aws.html) for more
information.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "vault_auth_backend" "aws" {
  type = "aws"
}

resource "vault_aws_auth_backend_role" "example" {
  backend                         = vault_auth_backend.aws.path
  role                            = "test-role"
  auth_type                       = "iam"
  bound_ami_ids                   = ["ami-8c1be5f6"]
  bound_account_ids               = ["123456789012"]
  bound_vpc_ids                   = ["vpc-b61106d4"]
  bound_subnet_ids                = ["vpc-133128f1"]
  bound_iam_role_arns             = ["arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/MyRole"]
  bound_iam_instance_profile_arns = ["arn:aws:iam::123456789012:instance-profile/MyProfile"]
  inferred_entity_type            = "ec2_instance"
  inferred_aws_region             = "us-east-1"
  token_ttl                       = 60
  token_max_ttl                   = 120
  token_policies                  = ["default", "dev", "prod"]
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `namespace` - (Optional) The namespace to provision the resource in.
  The value should not contain leading or trailing forward slashes.
  The `namespace` is always relative to the provider's configured [namespace](/docs/providers/vault#namespace).
   *Available only for Vault Enterprise*.

* `role` - (Required) The name of the role.

* `auth_type` - (Optional) The auth type permitted for this role. Valid choices
  are `ec2` and `iam`. Defaults to `iam`.

* `bound_ami_ids` - (Optional) If set, defines a constraint on the EC2 instances
  that can perform the login operation that they should be using the AMI ID
  specified by this field. `auth_type` must be set to `ec2` or
  `inferred_entity_type` must be set to `ec2_instance` to use this constraint.

* `bound_account_ids` - (Optional) If set, defines a constraint on the EC2
  instances that can perform the login operation that they should be using the
  account ID specified by this field. `auth_type` must be set to `ec2` or
  `inferred_entity_type` must be set to `ec2_instance` to use this constraint.

* `bound_regions` - (Optional) If set, defines a constraint on the EC2 instances
  that can perform the login operation that the region in their identity
  document must match the one specified by this field. `auth_type` must be set
  to `ec2` or `inferred_entity_type` must be set to `ec2_instance` to use this
  constraint.

* `bound_vpc_ids` - (Optional) If set, defines a constraint on the EC2 instances
  that can perform the login operation that they be associated with the VPC ID
  that matches the value specified by this field. `auth_type` must be set to
  `ec2` or `inferred_entity_type` must be set to `ec2_instance` to use this
  constraint.

* `bound_subnet_ids` - (Optional) If set, defines a constraint on the EC2
  instances that can perform the login operation that they be associated with
  the subnet ID that matches the value specified by this field. `auth_type`
  must be set to `ec2` or `inferred_entity_type` must be set to `ec2_instance`
  to use this constraint.

* `bound_iam_role_arns` - (Optional) If set, defines a constraint on the EC2
  instances that can perform the login operation that they must match the IAM
  role ARN specified by this field. `auth_type` must be set to `ec2` or
  `inferred_entity_type` must be set to `ec2_instance` to use this constraint.

* `bound_iam_instance_profile_arns` - (Optional) If set, defines a constraint on
  the EC2 instances that can perform the login operation that they must be
  associated with an IAM instance profile ARN which has a prefix that matches
  the value specified by this field. The value is prefix-matched as though it
  were a glob ending in `*`. `auth_type` must be set to `ec2` or
  `inferred_entity_type` must be set to `ec2_instance` to use this constraint.

* `role_tag` - (Optional) If set, enable role tags for this role. The value set
  for this field should be the key of the tag on the EC2 instance. `auth_type`
  must be set to `ec2` or `inferred_entity_type` must be set to `ec2_instance`
  to use this constraint.

* `bound_iam_principal_arns` - (Optional) If set, defines the IAM principal that
  must be authenticated when `auth_type` is set to `iam`. Wildcards are
  supported at the end of the ARN.

* `inferred_entity_type` - (Optional) If set, instructs Vault to turn on
  inferencing. The only valid value is `ec2_instance`, which instructs Vault to
  infer that the role comes from an EC2 instance in an IAM instance profile.
  This only applies when `auth_type` is set to `iam`.

* `inferred_aws_region` - (Optional) When `inferred_entity_type` is set, this
  is the region to search for the inferred entities. Required if
  `inferred_entity_type` is set. This only applies when `auth_type` is set to
  `iam`.

* `resolve_aws_unique_ids` - (Optional, Forces new resource) Only valid when
  `auth_type` is `iam`. If set to `true`, the `bound_iam_principal_arns` are
  resolved to [AWS Unique
  IDs](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_identifiers.html#identifiers-unique-ids)
  for the bound principal ARN. This field is ignored when a
  `bound_iam_principal_arn` ends in a wildcard. Resolving to unique IDs more
  closely mimics the behavior of AWS services in that if an IAM user or role is
  deleted and a new one is recreated with the same name, those new users or
  roles won't get access to roles in Vault that were permissioned to the prior
  principals of the same name. Defaults to `true`.
  Once set to `true`, this cannot be changed to `false` without recreating the role.

* `allow_instance_migration` - (Optional) If set to `true`, allows migration of
  the underlying instance where the client resides.

* `disallow_reauthentication` - (Optional) IF set to `true`, only allows a
  single token to be granted per instance ID. This can only be set when
  `auth_type` is set to `ec2`.

### Common Token Arguments

These arguments are common across several Authentication Token resources since Vault 1.2.

* `token_ttl` - (Optional) The incremental lifetime for generated tokens in number of seconds.
  Its current value will be referenced at renewal time.

* `token_max_ttl` - (Optional) The maximum lifetime for generated tokens in number of seconds.
  Its current value will be referenced at renewal time.

* `token_period` - (Optional) If set, indicates that the
  token generated using this role should never expire. The token should be renewed within the
  duration specified by this value. At each renewal, the token's TTL will be set to the
  value of this field. Specified in seconds.

* `token_policies` - (Optional) List of policies to encode onto generated tokens. Depending
  on the auth method, this list may be supplemented by user/group/other values.

* `token_bound_cidrs` - (Optional) List of CIDR blocks; if set, specifies blocks of IP
  addresses which can authenticate successfully, and ties the resulting token to these blocks
  as well.

* `token_explicit_max_ttl` - (Optional) If set, will encode an
  [explicit max TTL](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/concepts/tokens.html#token-time-to-live-periodic-tokens-and-explicit-max-ttls)
  onto the token in number of seconds. This is a hard cap even if `token_ttl` and
  `token_max_ttl` would otherwise allow a renewal.

* `token_no_default_policy` - (Optional) If set, the default policy will not be set on
  generated tokens; otherwise it will be added to the policies set in token_policies.

* `token_num_uses` - (Optional) The [maximum number](https://www.vaultproject.io/api-docs/auth/aws#token_num_uses)
   of times a generated token may be used (within its lifetime); 0 means unlimited.

* `token_type` - (Optional) The type of token that should be generated. Can be `service`,
  `batch`, or `default` to use the mount's tuned default (which unless changed will be
  `service` tokens). For token store roles, there are two additional possibilities:
  `default-service` and `default-batch` which specify the type to return unless the client
  requests a different type at generation time.

## Attributes Reference

* `role_id` - The Vault generated role ID.

## Import

AWS auth backend roles can be imported using `auth/`, the `backend` path, `/role/`, and the `role` name e.g.

```
$ terraform import vault_aws_auth_backend_role.example auth/aws/role/test-role
```
