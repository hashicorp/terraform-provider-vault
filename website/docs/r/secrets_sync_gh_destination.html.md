# vault\_secrets\_sync\_gh\_destination

Creates a GitHub destination to synchronize secrets in Vault. Requires Vault 1.16+.
*Available only for Vault Enterprise*.

~> **Important** All data provided in the resource configuration will be
written in cleartext to state and plan files generated by Terraform, and
will appear in the console output when Terraform runs. Protect these
artifacts accordingly. See
[the main provider documentation](../index.html)
for more details.

For more information on syncing secrets with GitHub, please refer to the Vault
[documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/sync/github).

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "vault_secrets_sync_gh_destination" "gh" {
  name                 = "gh-dest"
  access_token         = var.access_token
  repository_owner     = var.repo_owner
  repository_name      = "repo-name-example"
  secret_name_template = "vault_{{ .MountAccessor | lowercase }}_{{ .SecretPath | lowercase }}"

  # Github destination-specific fields (Vault 1.18+)
  secrets_location     = "repository"
  environment_name     = "production"

  # Networking allowlist fields (Vault 1.19+)
  # IP Addresses must be in CIDR notations.
  allowed_ipv4_addresses = ["192.168.1.0/24", "10.0.0.0/8"]
  allowed_ipv6_addresses = ["2001:db8::/32"]
  allowed_ports        = [443, 80, 22]
  disable_strict_networking = false
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `namespace` - (Optional) The namespace to provision the resource in.
  The value should not contain leading or trailing forward slashes.
  The `namespace` is always relative to the provider's configured [namespace](/docs/providers/vault/index.html#namespace).

* `name` - (Required) Unique name of the GitHub destination.

* `access_token` - (Optional) Fine-grained or personal access token.
  Can be omitted and directly provided to Vault using the `GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment
  variable.

* `repository_owner` - (Optional) GitHub organization or username that owns the repository.
  Can be omitted and directly provided to Vault using the `GITHUB_REPOSITORY_OWNER` environment
  variable.

* `repository_name` - (Optional) Name of the repository.
  Can be omitted and directly provided to Vault using the `GITHUB_REPOSITORY_NAME` environment
  variable.

* `secret_name_template` - (Optional) Template describing how to generate external secret names.
  Supports a subset of the Go Template syntax.

* `granularity` - (Optional) Determines what level of information is synced as a distinct resource
  at the destination. Supports `secret-path` and `secret-key`.

* `app_name` - (Optional) The user-defined name of the GitHub App configuration. This is a reference to the name used   
  on the new endpoint when configuring the GitHub app on the Vault Server. Can be modified. 
  Takes precedence over the `access_token` field.

* `installation_id` -(Optional) The ID of the installation generated by GitHub when the app referenced by the `app_name` 
  was installed in the user's GitHub account. Can be modified. Necessary if the `app_name` field is also provided.

* `allowed_ipv4_addresses` - (Optional) List of allowed IPv4 addresses in CIDR notation (e.g., `192.168.1.1/32`)
  for outbound connections from Vault to the destination. If not set, all IPv4 addresses are allowed.
  Requires Vault 1.19+.

* `allowed_ipv6_addresses` - (Optional) List of allowed IPv6 addresses in CIDR notation (e.g., `2001:db8::1/128`)
  for outbound connections from Vault to the destination. If not set, all IPv6 addresses are allowed.
  Requires Vault 1.19+.

* `allowed_ports` - (Optional) List of allowed ports for outbound connections from Vault to the
  destination. If not set, all ports are allowed. Requires Vault 1.19+.

* `disable_strict_networking` - (Optional) If set to `true`, disables strict networking enforcement
  for this destination. When disabled, Vault will not enforce allowed IP addresses and ports.
  Defaults to `false`. Requires Vault 1.19+.

* `secrets_location` - (Optional) Location where secrets are stored in the destination. Requires Vault 1.18+.

* `environment_name` - (Optional) Environment name for the destination. Requires Vault 1.18+. 

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported in addition to the above:

* `type` - The type of the secrets destination (`gh`).

## Import

GitHub Secrets sync destinations can be imported using the `name`, e.g.

```
$ terraform import vault_secrets_sync_gh_destination.gh gh-dest
```
