# vault\_secrets\_sync\_gh\_destination

Creates a GitHub destination to synchronize secrets in Vault. Requires Vault 1.16+.
*Available only for Vault Enterprise*.

~> **Important** All data provided in the resource configuration will be
written in cleartext to state and plan files generated by Terraform, and
will appear in the console output when Terraform runs. Protect these
artifacts accordingly. See
[the main provider documentation](../index.html)
for more details.

For more information on syncing secrets with GitHub, please refer to the Vault
[documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/sync/github).

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "vault_secrets_sync_gh_destination" "gh" {
  name                 = "gh-dest"
  access_token         = var.access_token
  repository_owner     = var.repo_owner
  repository_name      = "repo-name-example"
  secret_name_template = "vault_{{ .MountAccessor | lowercase }}_{{ .SecretPath | lowercase }}"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `namespace` - (Optional) The namespace to provision the resource in.
  The value should not contain leading or trailing forward slashes.
  The `namespace` is always relative to the provider's configured [namespace](/docs/providers/vault/index.html#namespace).

* `name` - (Required) Unique name of the GitHub destination.

* `access_token` - (Optional) Fine-grained or personal access token.
  Can be omitted and directly provided to Vault using the `GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment
  variable.

* `repository_owner` - (Optional) GitHub organization or username that owns the repository.
  Can be omitted and directly provided to Vault using the `GITHUB_REPOSITORY_OWNER` environment
  variable.

* `repository_name` - (Optional) Name of the repository.
  Can be omitted and directly provided to Vault using the `GITHUB_REPOSITORY_NAME` environment
  variable.

* `secret_name_template` - (Optional) Template describing how to generate external secret names.
  Supports a subset of the Go Template syntax.

* `app_name` - (Optional) The user-defined name of the GitHub App configuration. This is a reference to the name used   
  on the new endpoint when configuring the GitHub app on the Vault Server. Can be modified. 
  Takes precedence over the `access_token` field.

* `installation_id` -(Optional) The ID of the installation generated by GitHub when the app referenced by the `app_name` 
  was installed in the userâ€™s GitHub account. Can be modified. Necessary if the `app_name` field is also provided.
