  Writes arbitrary data to a given path in Vault

# vault\_generic\_endpoint

Writes and manages arbitrary data at a given path in Vault.

This resource enables configuration of arbitrary vault endpoints. It can
be used when a resource type is not available for a type of endpoint,
including when the endpoint is provided by a third-party plugin. This
resource can be used for endpoints with dynamic behavior including
write-only configuration endpoints, endpoints that return different
fields when read from those that were written, and endpoints that return
data when written to. This makes it more flexible than
the [generic secret resource](generic_secret.html) for use with
arbitrary endpoints.

~> **Important** All data provided in the resource configuration will be
written in cleartext to state and plan files generated by Terraform, and
will appear in the console output when Terraform runs. Protect these
artifacts accordingly. See
[the main provider documentation](../index.html)
for more details.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "vault_auth_backend" "userpass" {
  type = "userpass"
}

resource "vault_generic_endpoint" "u1" {
  depends_on           = [vault_auth_backend.userpass]
  path                 = "auth/userpass/users/u1"
  ignore_absent_fields = true

  data_json = <<EOT
{
  "policies": ["p1"],
  "password": "changeme"
}
EOT
}

resource "vault_generic_endpoint" "u1_token" {
  depends_on     = [vault_generic_endpoint.u1]
  path           = "auth/userpass/login/u1"
  disable_read   = true
  disable_delete = true

  data_json = <<EOT
{
  "password": "changeme"
}
EOT
}

resource "vault_generic_endpoint" "u1_entity" {
  depends_on           = [vault_generic_endpoint.u1_token]
  disable_read         = true
  disable_delete       = true
  path                 = "identity/lookup/entity"
  ignore_absent_fields = true
  write_fields         = ["id"]

  data_json = <<EOT
{
  "alias_name": "u1",
  "alias_mount_accessor": vault_auth_backend.userpass.accessor
}
EOT
}

output "u1_id" {
  value = vault_generic_endpoint.u1_entity.write_data["id"]
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `path` - (Required) The full logical path at which to write the given
  data. Consult each backend's documentation to see which endpoints
  support the `PUT` methods and to determine whether they also support
  `DELETE` and `GET`.

* `data_json` - (Required) String containing a JSON-encoded object that will be
  written to the given path as the secret data.

* `disable_read` - (Optional) True/false. Set this to true if your vault
  authentication is not able to read the data or if the endpoint does
  not support the `GET` method. Setting this to `true` will break drift
  detection. You should set this to `true` for endpoints that are
  write-only. Defaults to false.

* `disable_delete`: - (Optional) True/false. Set this to true if your
  vault authentication is not able to delete the data or if the endpoint
  does not support the `DELETE` method. Defaults to false.

* `ignore_absent_fields`: - (Optional) True/false. If set to true,
  ignore any fields present when the endpoint is read but that were not
  in `data_json`. Also, if a field that was written is not returned when
  the endpoint is read, treat that field as being up to date. You should
  set this to `true` when writing to endpoint that, when read, returns a
  different set of fields from the ones you wrote, as is common with
  many configuration endpoints. Defaults to false.

* `write_fields`: - (Optional). A list of fields that should be returned
  in `write_data_json` and `write_data`. If omitted, data returned by
  the write operation is not available to the resource or included in
  state. This helps to avoid accidental storage of sensitive values in
  state. Some endpoints, such as many dynamic secrets endpoints, return
  data from writing to an endpoint rather than reading it. You should
  use `write_fields` if you need information returned in this way.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the fields above, the following attributes are exported:

* `write_data_json`: - The JSON data returned by the write operation.
  Only fields set in `write_fields` are present in the JSON data.

* `write_data`: - A map whose keys are the top-level data keys
  returned from Vault by the write operation and whose values are the
  corresponding values. This map can only represent string data, so
  any non-string values returned from Vault are serialized as JSON.
  Only fields set in `write_fields` are present in the JSON data.

## Required Vault Capabilities

Use of this resource requires the `create` or `update` capability
(depending on whether the resource already exists) on the given path. If
`disable_delete` is false, the `delete` capbility is also required. If
`disable_delete` is false, the `read` capbility is required.

## Import

Import is not supported for this resource.
