# vault\_keymgmt\_azure\_kms

Manages an Azure Key Vault provider in the Vault Key Management secrets engine. This resource configures Vault to integrate with Azure Key Vault, allowing keys created in Vault to be distributed to Azure Key Vault for use in Azure services.

Once configured, keys can be distributed to Azure Key Vault using the `vault_keymgmt_distribute_key` resource.

~> **Important**
All data provided in the resource configuration will be written in cleartext to
state and plan files generated by Terraform, and will appear in the console
output when Terraform runs. Protect these artifacts accordingly. See [the main provider documentation](../index.html) for more details.

For more information on managing Azure Key Vault with Vault, please refer to the Vault [documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/secrets/key-management).

**Note** this feature is available only with Vault Enterprise.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "vault_mount" "keymgmt" {
  path = "keymgmt"
  type = "keymgmt"
}

  path           = vault_mount.keymgmt.path
  name           = "azure-production"
  key_collection = "my-keyvault"
  tenant_id      = var.azure_tenant_id
  client_id      = var.azure_client_id
  client_secret  = var.azure_client_secret
  environment    = "AzurePublicCloud"
}
