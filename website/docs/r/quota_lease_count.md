  Manage Lease Count Quota

# vault\_quota\_lease\_count

Manage lease count quotas which enforce the number of leases that can be created.
A lease count quota can be created at the root level or defined on a namespace or mount by
specifying a path when creating the quota.

See [Vault's Documentation](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/enterprise/lease-count-quotas) for more
information.   

**Note** this feature is available only with Vault Enterprise.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "vault_quota_lease_count" "global" {
  name = "global"
  path = ""
  max_leases = 100
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `namespace` - (Optional) The namespace to provision the resource in.
  The value should not contain leading or trailing forward slashes.
  The `namespace` is always relative to the provider's configured [namespace](../index.html#namespace).
   *Available only for Vault Enterprise*.

* `name` - (Required) Name of the rate limit quota

* `path` - (Optional) Path of the mount or namespace to apply the quota. A blank path configures a
  global rate limit quota. For example `namespace1/` adds a quota to a full namespace,
  `namespace1/auth/userpass` adds a `quota` to `userpass` in `namespace1`.
  Updating this field on an existing quota can have "moving" effects. For example, updating
  `auth/userpass` to `namespace1/auth/userpass` moves this quota from being a global mount quota to
  a namespace specific mount quota. **Note, namespaces are supported in Enterprise only.**

* `max_leases` - (Required) The maximum number of leases to be allowed by the quota
  rule. The `max_leases` must be positive.

* `role` - (Optional) If set on a quota where `path` is set to an auth mount with a concept of roles (such as /auth/approle/), this will make the quota restrict login requests to that mount that are made with the specified role.

* `inheritable` - (Optional) If set to `true` on a quota where path is set to a namespace, the same quota will be cumulatively applied to all child namespace. The inheritable parameter cannot be set to `true` if the path does not specify a namespace. Only the quotas associated with the root namespace are inheritable by default. Requires Vault 1.15+.
