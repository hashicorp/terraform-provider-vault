# vault\_jwt\_auth\_backend\_role

Manages an JWT/OIDC auth backend role in a Vault server. See the [Vault
documentation](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/jwt.html) for more
information.

## Example Usage

Role for JWT backend:

```hcl
resource "vault_jwt_auth_backend" "jwt" {
  path = "jwt"
}

resource "vault_jwt_auth_backend_role" "example" {
  backend         = vault_jwt_auth_backend.jwt.path
  role_name       = "test-role"
  token+policies  = ["default", "dev", "prod"]

  bound_audiences = ["https://myco.test"]
  user_claim      = "https://vault/user"
  role_type       = "jwt"
}
```

Role for OIDC backend:

```hcl
resource "vault_jwt_auth_backend" "oidc" {
  path = "oidc"
  default_role = "test-role"
}

resource "vault_jwt_auth_backend_role" "example" {
  backend         = vault_jwt_auth_backend.oidc.path
  role_name       = "test-role"
  token_policies  = ["default", "dev", "prod"]

  bound_audiences       = ["https://myco.test"]
  user_claim            = "https://vault/user"
  role_type             = "oidc"
  allowed_redirect_uris = ["http://localhost:8200/ui/vault/auth/oidc/oidc/callback"]
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `role_name` - (Required) The name of the role.

* `role_type` - (Optional) Type of role, either "oidc" (default) or "jwt".

* `bound_audiences` - (Required) List of `aud` claims to match
  against. Any match is sufficient.

* `user_claim` - (Required) The claim to use to uniquely identify
  the user; this will be used as the name for the Identity entity alias created
  due to a successful login.

* `bound_subject` - (Optional) If set, requires that the `sub` claim matches
  this value.

* `bound_claims` - (Optional) If set, a map of claims/values to match against.
  The expected value may be a single string or a list of strings.

* `claim_mappings` - (Optional) If set, a map of claims (keys) to be copied
  to specified metadata fields (values).

* `oidc_scopes` - (Optional) If set, a list of OIDC scopes to be used with an OIDC role.
  The standard scope "openid" is automatically included and need not be specified.

* `groups_claim` - (Optional) The claim to use to uniquely identify
  the set of groups to which the user belongs; this will be used as the names
  for the Identity group aliases created due to a successful login. The claim
  value must be a list of strings.

* `groups_claim_delimiter_pattern` - (Optional; Deprecated. This field has been
  removed since Vault 1.1. If the groups claim is not at the top level, it can
  now be specified as a [JSONPointer](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901).)
  A pattern of delimiters
  used to allow the groups_claim to live outside of the top-level JWT structure.
  For instance, a groups_claim of meta/user.name/groups with this field
  set to // will expect nested structures named meta, user.name, and groups.
  If this field was set to /./ the groups information would expect to be
  via nested structures of meta, user, name, and groups.

* `backend` - (Optional) The unique name of the auth backend to configure.
  Defaults to `jwt`.

* `allowed_redirect_uris` - (Optional) The list of allowed values for redirect_uri during OIDC logins.
  Required for OIDC roles

* `clock_skew_leeway` - (Optional) The amount of leeway to add to all claims to account for clock skew, in
  seconds. Defaults to `60` seconds if set to `0` and can be disabled if set to `-1`.
  Only applicable with "jwt" roles.

* `expiration_leeway` - (Optional) The amount of leeway to add to expiration (`exp`) claims to account for
  clock skew, in seconds. Defaults to `60` seconds if set to `0` and can be disabled if set to `-1`.
  Only applicable with "jwt" roles.

* `not_before_leeway` - (Optional) The amount of leeway to add to not before (`nbf`) claims to account for
  clock skew, in seconds. Defaults to `60` seconds if set to `0` and can be disabled if set to `-1`.
  Only applicable with "jwt" roles.

* `verbose_oidc_logging` - (Optional) Log received OIDC tokens and claims when debug-level
  logging is active. Not recommended in production since sensitive information may be present
  in OIDC responses.

### Common Token Arguments

These arguments are common across several Authentication Token resources since Vault 1.2.

* `token_ttl` - (Optional) The incremental lifetime for generated tokens in number of seconds.
  Its current value will be referenced at renewal time.

* `token_max_ttl` - (Optional) The maximum lifetime for generated tokens in number of seconds.
  Its current value will be referenced at renewal time.

* `token_policies` - (Optional) List of policies to encode onto generated tokens. Depending
  on the auth method, this list may be supplemented by user/group/other values.

* `token_bound_cidrs` - (Optional) List of CIDR blocks; if set, specifies blocks of IP
  addresses which can authenticate successfully, and ties the resulting token to these blocks
  as well.

* `token_explicit_max_ttl` - (Optional) If set, will encode an
  [explicit max TTL](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/concepts/tokens.html#token-time-to-live-periodic-tokens-and-explicit-max-ttls)
  onto the token in number of seconds. This is a hard cap even if `token_ttl` and
  `token_max_ttl` would otherwise allow a renewal.

* `token_no_default_policy` - (Optional) If set, the default policy will not be set on
  generated tokens; otherwise it will be added to the policies set in token_policies.

* `token_num_uses` - (Optional) The
  [period](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/concepts/tokens.html#token-time-to-live-periodic-tokens-and-explicit-max-ttls),
  if any, in number of seconds to set on the token.

* `token_type` - (Optional) The type of token that should be generated. Can be `service`,
  `batch`, or `default` to use the mount's tuned default (which unless changed will be
  `service` tokens). For token store roles, there are two additional possibilities:
  `default-service` and `default-batch` which specify the type to return unless the client
  requests a different type at generation time.

### Deprecated Arguments

These arguments are deprecated since Vault 1.2 in favour of the common token arguments
documented above.

* `num_uses` - (Optional; Deprecated, use `token_num_uses` instead) If set, puts a use-count
  limitation on the issued token.

* `ttl` - (Optional; Deprecated, use `token_ttl` isntead) The TTL period of tokens issued
  using this role, provided as a number of seconds.

* `max_ttl` - (Optional; Deprecated, use `token_max_ttl` instead) The maximum allowed lifetime of tokens
  issued using this role, provided as a number of seconds.

* `policies` - (Optional; Deprecated, use `token_policies` instead) An array of strings
  specifying the policies to be set on tokens issued using this role.

* `period` - (Optional; Deprecated, use `token_period` instead) If set, indicates that the
  token generated using this role should never expire. The token should be renewed within the
  duration specified by this value. At each renewal, the token's TTL will be set to the
  value of this field. The maximum allowed lifetime of token issued using this
  role. Specified as a number of seconds.

* `bound_cidrs` - (Optional; Deprecated, use `token_bound_cidrs` instead) If set, a list of
  CIDRs valid as the source address for login requests. This value is also encoded into any resulting token.
