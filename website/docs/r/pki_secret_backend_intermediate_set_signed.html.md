Submits the CA certificate to the PKI Secret Backend.

~> **Important** All data provided in the resource configuration will be
written in cleartext to state and plan files generated by Terraform, and
will appear in the console output when Terraform runs. Protect these
artifacts accordingly. See
[the main provider documentation](../index.html)
for more details.

~> **Important** Multi-Issuer Functionality is enabled on this version
of the Provider. If migrating from an older version of Vault or the Provider,
please refer to the [PKI Multi-Issuer Upgrade Guide](../guides/pki_multi_issuer_upgrade.html.markdown)

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `namespace` - (Optional) The namespace to provision the resource in.
  The value should not contain leading or trailing forward slashes.
  The `namespace` is always relative to the provider's configured [namespace](/docs/providers/vault/index.html#namespace).
   *Available only for Vault Enterprise*.

* `backend` - (Required) The PKI secret backend the resource belongs to.

* `certificate` - (Required) Specifies the PEM encoded certificate. May optionally append additional
  CA certificates to populate the whole chain, which will then enable returning the full chain from
  issue and sign operations.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `imported_issuers` - The imported issuers indicating which issuers were created as part of
  this request.

* `imported_keys` - The imported keys indicating which keys were created as part of this request.
