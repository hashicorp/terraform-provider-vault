  Creates an AWS destination to synchronize secrets in Vault
---

# vault\_secrets\_sync\_aws\_destination

Creates an AWS destination to synchronize secrets in Vault. Requires Vault 1.16+.
*Available only for Vault Enterprise*.

~> **Important** All data provided in the resource configuration will be
written in cleartext to state and plan files generated by Terraform, and
will appear in the console output when Terraform runs. Protect these
artifacts accordingly. See
[the main provider documentation](../index.html)
for more details.

For more information on syncing secrets with AWS, please refer to the Vault
[documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/sync/awssm).

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "vault_secrets_sync_aws_destination" "aws" {
  name                 = "aws-dest"
  access_key_id        = var.access_key_id
  secret_access_key    = var.secret_access_key
  region               = "us-east-1"
  role_arn             = "role-arn"
  external_id          = "external-id"
  secret_name_template = "vault_{{ .MountAccessor | lowercase }}_{{ .SecretPath | lowercase }}"
  custom_tags = {
    "foo" = "bar"
  }
}
```

### Example with Networking Restrictions

```hcl
resource "vault_secrets_sync_aws_destination" "aws_restricted" {
  name                      = "aws-dest-restricted"
  access_key_id             = var.access_key_id
  secret_access_key         = var.secret_access_key
  region                    = "us-east-1"
  allowed_ipv4_addresses    = ["192.168.1.0/24", "10.0.0.0/8"]
  allowed_ipv6_addresses    = ["2001:db8::/32"]
  allowed_ports             = [443, 8200]
  disable_strict_networking = false
}
```

### Using Workload Identity Federation (Vault 2.0.0+)

```hcl
resource "vault_secrets_sync_aws_destination" "aws_wif" {
  name                    = "aws-dest-wif"
  region                  = "us-east-1"
  role_arn                = var.role_arn
  identity_token_audience = var.identity_token_audience
  identity_token_ttl      = 3600
  identity_token_key      = "my-key"
  granularity             = "secret-path"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `namespace` - (Optional) The namespace to provision the resource in.
  The value should not contain leading or trailing forward slashes.
  The `namespace` is always relative to the provider's configured [namespace](/docs/providers/vault/index.html#namespace).

* `name` - (Required) Unique name of the AWS destination.

* `access_key_id` - (Optional) Access key id to authenticate against the AWS secrets manager.
  Can be omitted and directly provided to Vault using the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` environment
  variable.

* `secret_access_key` - (Optional) Secret access key to authenticate against the AWS secrets manager.
  Can be omitted and directly provided to Vault using the `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment
  variable.

* `region` - (Optional) Region where to manage the secrets manager entries.
  Can be omitted and directly provided to Vault using the `AWS_REGION` environment
  variable.

* `custom_tags` - (Optional) Custom tags to set on the secret managed at the destination.

* `secret_name_template` - (Optional) Template describing how to generate external secret names.
  Supports a subset of the Go Template syntax.

* `granularity` - (Optional) Determines what level of information is synced as a distinct resource 
  at the destination. Supports `secret-path` and `secret-key`.

* `role_arn` - (Optional) Specifies a role to assume when connecting to AWS. When assuming a role, 
  Vault uses temporary STS credentials to authenticate. An initial session with the proper trust relationship must 
  exist for Vault to be able to assume this role. The role can be in a different account. 
  The value is mutable as long as the new role targets the same AWS account ID. If not, the BE will return an error. 
  It is possible to provide both an access key pair and a role to assume.

* `external_id` - (Optional) Optional extra protection that must match the trust policy granting access to the
  AWS IAM role ARN. We recommend using a different random UUID per destination. The value is generated by users. 
  The field is mutable with no special condition, but users must be careful that the new value fits with the trust
  relationship condition they set on AWS otherwise sync operations will start to fail due to client-side access 
  denied errors. Ignored if the `role_arn` field is empty.

* `allowed_ipv4_addresses` - (Optional) Allowed IPv4 addresses for outbound connections from Vault to AWS Secrets Manager.
  Can also be set via an IP address range using CIDR notation. For example: `["192.168.1.0/24", "10.0.0.0/8"]`.
  **Requires Vault 1.19.0+**.

* `allowed_ipv6_addresses` - (Optional) Allowed IPv6 addresses for outbound connections from Vault to AWS Secrets Manager.
  Can also be set via an IP address range using CIDR notation. For example: `["2001:db8::/32"]`.
  **Requires Vault 1.19.0+**.

* `allowed_ports` - (Optional) Allowed ports for outbound connections from Vault to AWS Secrets Manager.
  For example: `[443, 8200]`.
  **Requires Vault 1.19.0+**.

* `disable_strict_networking` - (Optional) Disable strict networking mode. When set to `true`, Vault will not enforce
  allowed IP addresses and ports. Defaults to `false`.
  **Requires Vault 1.19.0+**.

### Workload Identity Federation (Vault 2.0.0+)

* `identity_token_audience` - (Optional) The audience claim value for identity tokens.
  **Requires Vault 2.0.0+**.

* `identity_token_ttl` - (Optional) The TTL of generated identity tokens in seconds.
  **Requires Vault 2.0.0+**.

* `identity_token_key` - (Optional) The key to use for signing identity tokens.
  **Requires Vault 2.0.0+**.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported in addition to the above:

* `type` - The type of the secrets destination (`aws-sm`).

## Import

AWS Secrets sync destinations can be imported using the `name`, e.g.

```
$ terraform import vault_secrets_sync_aws_destination.aws aws-dest
```
