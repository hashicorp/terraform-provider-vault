  Creates an AWS secret backend for Vault.

# vault\_aws\_secret\_backend

Creates an AWS Secret Backend for Vault. AWS secret backends can then issue AWS
access keys and secret keys, once a role has been added to the backend.

~> **Important** All data provided in the resource configuration will be
written in cleartext to state and plan files generated by Terraform, and
will appear in the console output when Terraform runs. Protect these
artifacts accordingly. See
[the main provider documentation](../index.html)
for more details.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "vault_aws_secret_backend" "aws" {
  access_key = "AKIA....."
  secret_key = "AWS secret key"
}
```

```hcl
resource "vault_aws_secret_backend" "aws" { 
  identity_token_audience   = "<TOKEN_AUDIENCE>"
  identity_token_ttl        = "<TOKEN_TTL>"
  role_arn		    = "<AWS_ROLE_ARN>"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `namespace` - (Optional) The namespace to provision the resource in.
  The value should not contain leading or trailing forward slashes.
  The `namespace` is always relative to the provider's configured [namespace](/docs/providers/vault#namespace).
   *Available only for Vault Enterprise*.

* `access_key` - (Optional) The AWS Access Key ID this backend should use to
issue new credentials. Vault uses the official AWS SDK to authenticate, and thus can also use standard AWS environment credentials, shared file credentials or IAM role/ECS task credentials.

* `secret_key` - (Optional) The AWS Secret Key this backend should use to
issue new credentials. Vault uses the official AWS SDK to authenticate, and thus can also use standard AWS environment credentials, shared file credentials or IAM role/ECS task credentials.

~> **Important** Vault version 1.2.3 and older does not support reading the configured
credentials back from the API, With these older versions, Terraform cannot detect and correct drift
on `access_key` or `secret_key`. Changing the values, however, _will_
overwrite the previously stored values. With versions of Vault newer than
1.2.3, reading the `access_key` only is supported, and so drifts of the
`access_key` will be detected and corrected, but drifts on the `secret_key`
will not.

* `region` - (Optional) The AWS region for API calls. Defaults to `us-east-1`.

~> **Important** The same limitation noted above for the `access_key` parameter
also applies to the `region` parameter. Vault versions 1.2.3 and older will not
allow Terraform to detect (and thus correct) drift in the `region` parameter,
while newer versions of Vault will.

* `path` - (Optional) The unique path this backend should be mounted at. Must
not begin or end with a `/`. Defaults to `aws`.

* `disable_remount` - (Optional) If set, opts out of mount migration on path updates.
  See here for more info on [Mount Migration](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/concepts/mount-migration)

* `description` - (Optional) A human-friendly description for this backend.

* `default_lease_ttl_seconds` - (Optional) The default TTL for credentials
issued by this backend.

* `max_lease_ttl_seconds` - (Optional) The maximum TTL that can be requested
for credentials issued by this backend.

* `iam_endpoint` - (Optional) Specifies a custom HTTP IAM endpoint to use.

* `sts_endpoint` - (Optional) Specifies a custom HTTP STS endpoint to use.

* `username_template` - (Optional)  Template describing how dynamic usernames are generated. The username template is used to generate both IAM usernames (capped at 64 characters) and STS usernames (capped at 32 characters). If no template is provided the field defaults to the template:

* `local` - (Optional) Specifies whether the secrets mount will be marked as local. Local mounts are not replicated to performance replicas.

* `identity_token_audience` - (Optional) The audience claim value.

* `identity_token_ttl` - (Optional) The TTL of generated identity tokens in seconds.

* `identity_token_key` - (Optional) The key to use for signing identity tokens.

* `role_arn` - (Optional) Role ARN to assume for plugin identity token federation.

```
{{ if (eq .Type "STS") }}
    {{ printf "vault-%s-%s" (unix_time) (random 20) | truncate 32 }}
{{ else }}
    {{ printf "vault-%s-%s-%s" (printf "%s-%s" (.DisplayName) (.PolicyName) | truncate 42) (unix_time) (random 20) | truncate 64 }}
{{ end }}

```
