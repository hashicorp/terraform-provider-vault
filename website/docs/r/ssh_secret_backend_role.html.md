    backend                 = "${vault_mount.example.path}"
    key_type                = "ca"
    allow_user_certificates = true
}

resource "vault_ssh_secret_backend_role" "bar" {
    name          = "otp-role"
    backend       = "${vault_mount.example.path}"
    key_type      = "otp"
    default_user  = "default"
    allowed_users = "default,baz"
