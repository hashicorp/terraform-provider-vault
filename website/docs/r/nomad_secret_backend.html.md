# vault\_nomad\_secret\_backend

Creates a Nomad Secret Backend for Vault. The Nomad secret backend for Vault
generates Nomad ACL tokens dynamically based on pre-existing Nomad ACL policies.

~> **Important** All data provided in the resource configuration will be
written in cleartext to state and plan files generated by Terraform, and
will appear in the console output when Terraform runs. Protect these
artifacts accordingly. See
[the main provider documentation](../index.html)
for more details.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "vault_nomad_secret_backend" "config" {
	backend                   = "nomad"
	description               = "test description"
	default_lease_ttl_seconds = "3600"
	max_lease_ttl_seconds     = "7200"
	max_ttl                   = "240"
	address                   = "https://127.0.0.1:4646"
	token                     = "ae20ceaa-..."
	ttl                       = "120"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `namespace` - (Optional) The namespace to provision the resource in.
  The value should not contain leading or trailing forward slashes.
  The `namespace` is always relative to the provider's configured [namespace](/docs/providers/vault/index.html#namespace).
   *Available only for Vault Enterprise*.

* `backend` - (Optional) The unique path this backend should be mounted at. Must
not begin or end with a `/`. Defaults to `nomad`.

* `disable_remount` - (Optional) If set, opts out of mount migration on path updates.
  See here for more info on [Mount Migration](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/concepts/mount-migration)

* `address` - (Optional) Specifies the address of the Nomad instance, provided
as "protocol://host:port" like "http://127.0.0.1:4646".

* `ca_cert` - (Optional) CA certificate to use when verifying the Nomad server certificate, must be
x509 PEM encoded.

* `client_cert` - (Optional) Client certificate to provide to the Nomad server, must be x509 PEM encoded.

* `client_key` - (Optional) Client certificate key to provide to the Nomad server, must be x509 PEM encoded.
  Conflicts with `client_key_wo`.

* `client_key_wo_version` - (Optional) Version counter for the write-only client key. This must be incremented
  each time the `client_key_wo` value is changed to trigger an update. Required when using `client_key_wo`.

* `max_token_name_length` - (Optional) Specifies the maximum length to use for the name of the Nomad token
generated with Generate Credential. If omitted, 0 is used and ignored, defaulting to the max value allowed
by the Nomad version.

* `max_ttl` - (Optional) Maximum possible lease duration for secrets in seconds.

* `token` - (Optional) Specifies the Nomad Management token to use. Conflicts with `token_wo`.

* `token_wo_version` - (Optional) Version counter for the write-only token. This must be incremented each time
  the `token_wo` value is changed to trigger an update. Required when using `token_wo`.

* `ttl` - (Optional) Specifies the ttl of the lease for the generated token.

### Common Mount Arguments
These arguments are common across all resources that mount a secret engine.

* `description` - (Optional) Human-friendly description of the mount

* `default_lease_ttl_seconds` - (Optional) Default lease duration for tokens and secrets in seconds

* `max_lease_ttl_seconds` - (Optional) Maximum possible lease duration for tokens and secrets in seconds

* `audit_non_hmac_response_keys` - (Optional) Specifies the list of keys that will not be HMAC'd by audit devices in the response data object.

* `audit_non_hmac_request_keys` - (Optional) Specifies the list of keys that will not be HMAC'd by audit devices in the request data object.

* `local` - (Optional) Boolean flag that can be explicitly set to true to enforce local mount in HA environment

* `options` - (Optional) Specifies mount type specific options that are passed to the backend

* `seal_wrap` - (Optional) Boolean flag that can be explicitly set to true to enable seal wrapping for the mount, causing values stored by the mount to be wrapped by the seal's encryption capability

* `external_entropy_access` - (Optional) Boolean flag that can be explicitly set to true to enable the secrets engine to access Vault's external entropy source

* `allowed_managed_keys` - (Optional) Set of managed key registry entry names that the mount in question is allowed to access

* `listing_visibility` - (Optional) Specifies whether to show this mount in the UI-specific
  listing endpoint. Valid values are `unauth` or `hidden`. If not set, behaves like `hidden`.

* `passthrough_request_headers` - (Optional) List of headers to allow and pass from the request to
  the plugin.

* `allowed_response_headers` - (Optional) List of headers to allow, allowing a plugin to include
  them in the response.

* `delegated_auth_accessors` - (Optional)  List of allowed authentication mount accessors the
  backend can request delegated authentication for.

* `plugin_version` - (Optional) Specifies the semantic version of the plugin to use, e.g. "v1.0.0".
  If unspecified, the server will select any matching unversioned plugin that may have been
  registered, the latest versioned plugin registered, or a built-in plugin in that order of precedence.

* `identity_token_key` - (Optional)  The key to use for signing plugin workload identity tokens. If
  not provided, this will default to Vault's OIDC default key. Requires Vault Enterprise 1.16+.

## Ephemeral Attributes Reference

The following write-only attributes are supported:

* `client_key_wo` - (Optional) Write-only client certificate key to provide to the Nomad server, must be x509 PEM encoded.
  Use this for enhanced security when you don't want the client key to appear in state files. Requires `client_key_wo_version`. Conflicts with `client_key`.
  **Note**: This property is write-only and will not be read from the API.

* `token_wo` - (Optional) Write-only Nomad Management token to use.
  Use this for enhanced security when you don't want the token to appear in state files. Requires `token_wo_version`. Conflicts with `token`.
  **Note**: This property is write-only and will not be read from the API.

## Attributes Reference

No additional attributes are exported by this resource.

## Import

Nomad secret backend can be imported using the `backend`, e.g.

```
$ terraform import vault_nomad_secret_backend.nomad nomad
```
