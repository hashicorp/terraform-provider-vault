# vault\_pki\_secret\_backend\_root\_cert

Generates a new self-signed CA certificate and private keys for the PKI Secret Backend.

~> **Important** All data provided in the resource configuration will be
written in cleartext to state and plan files generated by Terraform, and
will appear in the console output when Terraform runs. Protect these
artifacts accordingly. See
[the main provider documentation](../index.html)
for more details.

~> **Important** Multi-Issuer Functionality is enabled on this version
of the Provider. If migrating from an older version of Vault or the Provider,
please refer to the [PKI Multi-Issuer Upgrade Guide](../guides/pki_multi_issuer_upgrade.html.markdown)

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "vault_pki_secret_backend_root_cert" "test" {
  depends_on            = [vault_mount.pki]
  backend               = vault_mount.pki.path
  type                  = "internal"
  common_name           = "Root CA"
  ttl                   = "315360000"
  format                = "pem"
  private_key_format    = "der"
  key_type              = "rsa"
  key_bits              = 4096
  exclude_cn_from_sans  = true
  ou                    = "My OU"
  organization          = "My organization"
}
```

* `type` - (Required) Type of intermediate to create. Must be either \"exported\", \"internal\"
  or \"kms\"

* `common_name` - (Required) CN of intermediate to create

* `alt_names` - (Optional) List of alternative names

* `ip_sans` - (Optional) List of alternative IPs

* `uri_sans` - (Optional) List of alternative URIs

* `other_sans` - (Optional) List of other SANs

* `ttl` - (Optional) Time to live

* `format` - (Optional) The format of data

* `private_key_format` - (Optional) The private key format

* `key_type` - (Optional) The desired key type

* `key_bits` - (Optional) The number of bits to use

* `signature_bits` - (Optional) The number of bits to use in the signature algorithm

* `max_path_length` - (Optional) The maximum path length to encode in the generated certificate

* `exclude_cn_from_sans` - (Optional) Flag to exclude CN from SANs

* `permitted_dns_domains` - (Optional) List of domains for which certificates are allowed to be issued

* `excluded_dns_domains` - (Optional) List of domains for which certificates are not allowed to be issued. Requires Vault version 1.19+.

* `excluded_ip_ranges` - (Optional) List of IP ranges for which certificates are not allowed to be issued. Requires Vault version 1.19+.

* `permitted_email_addresses` - (Optional) List of email addresses for which certificates are allowed to be issued. Requires Vault version 1.19+.

* `excluded_email_addresses` - (Optional) List of email addresses for which certificates are not allowed to be issued. Requires Vault version 1.19+.

* `permitted_uri_domains` - (Optional) List of URI domains for which certificates are allowed to be issued. Requires Vault version 1.19+.

 required if `type` is `kms`  and it conflicts with `managed_key_id`

* `managed_key_id` - (Optional) The ID of the previously configured managed key. This field is
  required if `type` is `kms` and it conflicts with `managed_key_name`

* `issuer_name` - (Optional) Provides a name to the specified issuer. The name must be unique
  across all issuers and not be the reserved value `default`

* `key_name` - (Optional) When a new key is created with this request, optionally specifies
  the name for this. The global ref `default` may not be used as a name.

* `key_ref` - (Optional) Specifies the key (either default, by name, or by identifier) to use
  for generating this request. Only suitable for `type=existing` requests.

* `not_after` - (Optional) Set the Not After field of the certificate with specified date value. The value format should be given in UTC format YYYY-MM-ddTHH:MM:SSZ. Supports the Y10K end date for IEEE 802.1AR-2018 standard devices, 9999-12-31T23:59:59Z.
