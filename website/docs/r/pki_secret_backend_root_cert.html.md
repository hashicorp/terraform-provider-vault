# vault\_pki\_secret\_backend\_root\_cert

Generates a new self-signed CA certificate and private keys for the PKI Secret Backend.

~> **Important** All data provided in the resource configuration will be
written in cleartext to state and plan files generated by Terraform, and
will appear in the console output when Terraform runs. Protect these
artifacts accordingly. See
[the main provider documentation](../index.html)
for more details.

~> **Important** Multi-Issuer Functionality is enabled on this version
of the Provider. If migrating from an older version of Vault or the Provider,
please refer to the [PKI Multi-Issuer Upgrade Guide](../guides/pki_multi_issuer_upgrade.html.markdown)

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "vault_pki_secret_backend_root_cert" "test" {
  depends_on            = [vault_mount.pki]
  backend               = vault_mount.pki.path
  type                  = "internal"
  common_name           = "Root CA"
  ttl                   = "315360000"
  format                = "pem"
  private_key_format    = "der"
  key_type              = "rsa"
  key_bits              = 4096
  exclude_cn_from_sans  = true
  ou                    = "My OU"
  organization          = "My organization"
}
```

   *Available only for Vault Enterprise*.

* `backend` - (Required) The PKI secret backend the resource belongs to.

* `type` - (Required) Type of intermediate to create. Must be either \"exported\", \"internal\"
  or \"kms\"

* `common_name` - (Required) CN of intermediate to create

* `alt_names` - (Optional) List of alternative names

* `ip_sans` - (Optional) List of alternative IPs

* `uri_sans` - (Optional) List of alternative URIs

* `other_sans` - (Optional) List of other SANs

* `ttl` - (Optional) Time to live

* `format` - (Optional) The format of data

* `private_key_format` - (Optional) The private key format

* `key_type` - (Optional) The desired key type

* `key_bits` - (Optional) The number of bits to use

* `max_path_length` - (Optional) The maximum path length to encode in the generated certificate

* `exclude_cn_from_sans` - (Optional) Flag to exclude CN from SANs

* `permitted_dns_domains` - (Optional) List of domains for which certificates are allowed to be issued

* `ou` - (Optional) The organization unit

* `organization` - (Optional) The organization

* `country` - (Optional) The country

* `locality` - (Optional) The locality

* `province` - (Optional) The province

* `street_address` - (Optional) The street address

* `postal_code` - (Optional) The postal code

* `managed_key_name` - (Optional) The name of the previously configured managed key. This field is
 required if `type` is `kms`  and it conflicts with `managed_key_id`

* `managed_key_id` - (Optional) The ID of the previously configured managed key. This field is
  required if `type` is `kms` and it conflicts with `managed_key_name`

* `issuer_name` - (Optional) Provides a name to the specified issuer. The name must be unique
  across all issuers and not be the reserved value `default`

* `key_name` - (Optional) When a new key is created with this request, optionally specifies
  the name for this. The global ref `default` may not be used as a name.

* `key_ref` - (Optional) Specifies the key (either default, by name, or by identifier) to use
  for generating this request. Only suitable for `type=existing` requests.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the fields above, the following attributes are exported:

* `certificate` - The certificate.

* `issuing_ca` - The issuing CA certificate.

* `serial` - Deprecated, use `serial_number` instead.
 
* `serial_number` - The certificate's serial number, hex formatted.

* `issuer_id` - The ID of the generated issuer.

* `key_id` - The ID of the generated key.
