  Sets the CRL config on an PKI Secret Backend for Vault.

# vault\_pki\_secret\_backend\_crl\_config

Allows setting the duration for which the generated CRL should be marked valid. If the CRL is disabled, it will return a signed but zero-length CRL for any request. If enabled, it will re-build the CRL.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "vault_mount" "pki" {
  path                      = "%s"
  type                      = "pki"
  default_lease_ttl_seconds = 3600
  max_lease_ttl_seconds     = 86400
}

resource "vault_pki_secret_backend_crl_config" "crl_config" {
  backend = vault_mount.pki.path
  expiry  = "72h"
  disable = false
}
```

## Argument Reference

* `backend` - (Required) The path the PKI secret backend is mounted at, with no leading or trailing `/`s.

* `expiry` - (Optional) Specifies the time until expiration.
