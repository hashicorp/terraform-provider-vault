# vault\_pki\_secret\_backend\_config\_est

Reads the PKI EST configuration from Vault Enterprise.

~> **Important** All data retrieved from Vault will be
written in cleartext to state file generated by Terraform, will appear in
the console output when Terraform runs, and may be included in plan files
if secrets are interpolated into any resource attributes.
Protect these artifacts accordingly. See
[the main provider documentation](../index.html)
for more details.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "vault_mount" "pki" {
  path        = "pki"
  type        = "pki"
  description = "PKI secret engine mount"
}

data "vault_pki_secret_backend_config_est" "est_config" {
  backend     = vault_mount.pki.path
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `namespace` - (Optional) The namespace of the target resource.

  The `namespace` is always relative to the provider's configured [namespace](/docs/providers/vault/index.html#namespace).
  *Available only for Vault Enterprise*.

* `backend` - (Required) The path to the PKI secret backend to
  read the EST configuration from, with no leading or trailing `/`s.
 
## Attributes Reference

* `default_mount` - Is this mount providing the cluster's default EST mount
 
* `default_path_policy` - The behavior of the default_mount when enabled
 
* `enable_sentinel_parsing` - Are fields from the provided CSR parsed out for Sentinel policies
 
* `enabled` - Is the EST feature enabled
 
* `label_to_path_policy` - A pairing of EST label to the configured EST behavior for it
 
* `audit_fields` - Fields parsed from the CSR that appear in the audit and can be used by sentinel policies
 
* `last_updated` - A read-only timestamp representing the last time the configuration was updated
