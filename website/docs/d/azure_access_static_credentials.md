# vault\_azure\_access\_static\_credentials

Generates or reads static Azure credentials for a static role managed by the Azure Secrets Engine.

~> **Important** All data retrieved from Vault will be
written in cleartext to state file generated by Terraform, will appear in
the console output when Terraform runs, and may be included in plan files
if secrets are interpolated into any resource attributes.
Protect these artifacts accordingly. See
[the main provider documentation](../index.html)
for more details.

## Description

When this data source is read, Vault automatically determines whether credentials already exist for the given role:

- If no credentials exist yet (a newly created static role), Vault creates and stores the initial client secret for the associated Azure AD application.
- If credentials already exist (through the import workflow), Vault simply returns the existing credential instead of generating a new one.

After credentials have been generated or imported, subsequent reads of this data source return the same stored credential until it is rotated in Vault.  
To manually rotate static credentials, call the `/rotate-role/<role>` endpoint using the Vault CLI or API.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "vault_azure_static_access_credentials" "azurerole" {
  backend = vault_azure_secret_backend.azure.path
  role    = vault_azure_secret_backend_static_role.azurerole.role
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `backend` - (Required) Path to the mounted Azure Secrets Engine where the static role resides.

* `role` - (Required) The name of the static role to generate or read credentials for.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `client_id` - The Azure AD Applicationâ€™s client ID associated with this static role.

* `client_secret` - The managed client secret value for the application.

* `secret_id` - The Azure Key ID corresponding to the current client secret.

* `expiration` - The expiration timestamp (in RFC3339 format) of the credential, as reported by Azure.

* `metadata` - A map of key-value pairs associated with the static role and included in the credential response.
