# vault\_identity\_oidc\_client\_creds

Reads well known public keys from an OIDC Provider provisioned in Vault.

~> **Important** All data retrieved from Vault will be
written in cleartext to state file generated by Terraform, will appear in
the console output when Terraform runs, and may be included in plan files
if secrets are interpolated into any resource attributes.
Protect these artifacts accordingly. See
[the main provider documentation](../index.html)
for more details.

  verification_ttl   = 3600
}

resource "vault_identity_oidc_client" "app" {
  name          = "application"
  key           = vault_identity_oidc_key.key.name
