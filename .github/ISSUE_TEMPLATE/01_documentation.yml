        # Thank you for raising a documentation issue!

        This form is meant to alert the maintainers to an issue with the
        provider documentation found on the [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/vault/latest)
        such as resource and data source documentation, guides and examples.

        Documentation edits are generally a bit less involved, so are often a
        great entrypoint if you've ever been interested in contributing.
