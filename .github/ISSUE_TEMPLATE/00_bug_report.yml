        # Thank you for raising a bug report!

        Before submitting a bug report, we ask that you first search existing
        issues to see if someone else may have experienced the same issue. This
        helps to keep all relevant information in one place, including any
        potential workarounds.

        We also ask that you consider whether your issue may be related to
        Terraform Core. If you are running into one of the following scenarios,
        we recommend [opening an issue](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/new/choose)
        in the Terraform Core repository instead:

        * [Configuration Language](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/index.html) or resource ordering issues
        * [State](https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/index.html) and [State Backend](https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/index.html) issues
        * [Provisioner](https://www.terraform.io/docs/provisioners/index.html) issues
        * [Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/) issues
        * Spans resources across multiple providers

        # Terraform and Vault Provider Versions

        Please run `terraform -v` to show the Terraform Core and provider
        version(s). If you are not running the latest version of either the
        provider or Terraform Core, please consider upgrading, as your issue
        may have already been fixed.

        # Description

        In the next few fields, please provide any useful information you can
        around what resources are affected, what you expected to happen, and
        what actually happened. There is also a field to optionally provide a
        small snippet of any relevant error or panic output.

        Note that there is a section later in the form to provide more complete
        Terraform configuration and logging information. These fields should
        instead be thought of as the place to briefly describe the bug.

        If applicable, provide a relevant snippet from the error or panic
        output. This will be rendered as `shell`, so there is no need to add a
        [code fence](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks).

        # Configuration and Logging

        Here, we ask that you provide the Terraform configuration and, when
        possible, the debug logs. For configurations or logs of more than just
        a few lines, it's preferred to either share a Gist link or zip the
        files and upload them.

        Terraform configurations or debug logs under 25MB may be
        [attached directly in the field](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/attaching-files).
        Files larger than this should be uploaded to a file hosting service and
        a link shared.

        For your security you can also encrypt the files using our [GPG public key](https://keybase.io/hashicorp).

        **Note:** These form fields do not automatically render, so you will
        need to use [code fence(s)](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/#quoting-code)
        to achieve proper formatting.

  - type: textarea

      label: Terraform Configuration Files
      description: |
        Please paste, upload, or link to a file or Gist containing all
        Terraform configurations required to reproduce the bug. See note above
        for additional information on file size restrictions and encrypting.

        Bug reports without a functional reproduction may be closed without investigation.

        restrictions and encrypting.

        To obtain the debug output, see the

        # Additional Information

        For the final two fields, optionally provide any additional context
        that might help the community or maintainers to investigate the bug.
        This might be additional references that you found when
        troubleshooting, similar bug reports, or specifics about your
        environment that might be unique.

        maintainers and community know (you can update this later if you change
        your mind). If this would be your first contribution, refer to
