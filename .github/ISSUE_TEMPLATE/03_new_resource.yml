        This form is intended to be used when requesting an entirely new resource, data source, or service be added to the provider. If you're looking for a change to be made to an existing resource or data source, consider submitting either the "Request an Enhancement" or Report a Bug" forms instead.

        Please update the title to match what you're requesting, e.g.:

        - `[New Resource]:` - for new resource requests
        - `[New Data Source]:` - for new data source requests
