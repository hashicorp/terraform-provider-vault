        # Thank you for opening an enhancement request!

        This form is intended as a way to request additional functionality for
        existing resources, data sources, or the provider itself. This may
        include requests such as adding additional arguments or attributes
        enabled by upstream API changes, additional validation for arguments,
        etc.

        If the absense of the requested feature is causing unexpected behavior
        in the provider, the "Report a Bug" form should be used. For entirely
        new resources, data sources, or services, please use the Request a "New
        Resource or Data Source" form.

      label: Potential Terraform Configuration
      description: |
        If this request was implemented, what might the Terraform configuration
        look like? A best guess is helpful, even if you're unsure of exactly
        what the end result will look like. This helps maintainers and the
        community better understand how you (someone who is in need of this
        feature) envisions it.

        **Note:** This field will render in HCL, so there is no need to add a
        [code fence](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks).
