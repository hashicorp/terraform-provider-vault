Maintainers
-----------

This provider plugin is maintained by the Vault team at [HashiCorp](https://www.hashicorp.com/).

Best Practices
--------------

We recommend that you avoid placing secrets in your Terraform config or state file wherever possible, and if placed there, you take steps to reduce and manage your risk. We have created a practical guide on how to do this with our opensource versions in Best Practices for Using HashiCorp Terraform with HashiCorp Vault:

[![Best Practices for Using HashiCorp Terraform with HashiCorp Vault](https://img.youtube.com/vi/fOybhcbuxJ0/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOybhcbuxJ0)

This webinar walks you through how to protect secrets when using Terraform with Vault. Additional security measures are available in paid Terraform versions as well.

Requirements
------------

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) 0.12.x and above, we recommend using the latest stable release whenever possible.
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) 1.19 (to build the provider plugin)

Building The Provider
---------------------

Clone repository to: `$GOPATH/src/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-vault`

```sh
$ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/hashicorp; cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/hashicorp
$ git clone git@github.com:hashicorp/terraform-provider-vault
```

Enter the provider directory and build the provider

```sh
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-vault
$ make build
```

Developing the Provider
---------------------------

If you wish to work on the provider, you'll first need [Go](http://www.golang.org) installed on your machine (version 1.19+ is *required*). You'll also need to correctly setup a [GOPATH](http://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH), as well as adding `$GOPATH/bin` to your `$PATH`.

To compile the provider, run `make build`. This will build the provider and put the provider binary in the `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

```sh
$ make build
...
$ $GOPATH/bin/terraform-provider-vault
...
```

In order to test the provider, you can simply run `make test`.

```sh
$ make test
```

In order to run the full suite of Acceptance tests, you will need the following:

*Note:* Acceptance tests create real resources, and often cost money to run.

1. An instance of Vault running to run the tests against
2. The following environment variables are set:
    - `VAULT_ADDR` - location of Vault
    - `VAULT_TOKEN` - token used to query Vault. These tests do not attempt to read `~/.vault-token`.
3. The following environment variables may need to be set depending on which acceptance tests you wish to run.
There may be additional variables for specific tests. Consult the specific test(s) for more information.
    - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
    - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
    - `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS` the contents of a GCP creds JSON, alternatively read from `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_FILE`
    - `RMQ_CONNECTION_URI`
    - `RMQ_USERNAME`
    - `RMQ_PASSWORD`
    - `ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`
    - `ARM_TENANT_ID`
    - `ARM_CLIENT_ID`
    - `ARM_CLIENT_SECRET`
    - `ARM_RESOURCE_GROUP`
4. Run `make testacc`

If you wish to run specific tests, use the `TESTARGS` environment variable:

```sh
TESTARGS="--run DataSourceAWSAccessCredentials" make testacc
```

Using a local development build
----------------------

It's possible to use a local build of the Vault provider with Terraform directly.
This is useful when testing the provider outside the acceptance test framework.

Configure Terraform to use the development build of the provider.

> **warning**: backup your `~/.terraformrc` before running this command:
 
```shell
cat > ~/.terraformrc <<HERE
provider_installation {
  dev_overrides {
    "hashicorp/vault" = "$HOME/.terraform.d/plugins"
  }
  
  # For all other providers, install them directly from their origin provider
  # registries as normal. If you omit this, Terraform will _only_ use
  # the dev_overrides block, and so no other providers will be available.
  direct {}
}
HERE
```

Then execute the `dev` make target from the project root.
```shell
make dev
```
Now Terraform is set up to use the `dev` provider build instead of the provider 
from the HashiCorp registry.

Debugging the Provider
---------------------------

The following is adapted from [Debugging Providers](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/plugin/debugging).

### Starting A Provider In Debug Mode

You can enable debbuging with the `make debug` target:

```shell
make debug
```

This target will build a binary with compiler optimizations disabled and copy
the provider binary to the `~/.terraform.d/plugins` directory. Next run Delve
on the host machine:

```shell
dlv exec --accept-multiclient --continue --headless --listen=:2345 \
  ~/.terraform.d/plugins/terraform-provider-vault -- -debug
```

The above command enables the debugger to run the process for you.
`terraform-provider-vault` is the name of the executable that was built with
the `make debug` target. The above command will also output the
`TF_REATTACH_PROVIDERS` information:

```shell
TF_REATTACH_PROVIDERS='{"hashicorp/vault":{"Protocol":"grpc","ProtocolVersion":5,"Pid":52780,"Test":true,"Addr":{"Network":"unix","String":"/var/folders/g1/9xn1l6mx0x1dry5wqm78fjpw0000gq/T/plugin2557833286"}}}'
```

Connect your debugger, such as your editor or the Delve CLI, to the debug
server. The following command will connect with the Delve CLI:

```shell
dlv connect :2345
```

At this point you may set breakpoint in your code.

### Running Terraform With A Provider In Debug Mode

Copy the line starting with `TF_REATTACH_PROVIDERS` from your provider's output.
Either export it, or prefix every Terraform command with it.

Run Terraform as usual. Any breakpoints you have set will halt execution and
show you the current variable values.
